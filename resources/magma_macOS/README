This archive contains the MAGMA source code and makefile. 
If you have a C++ compiler and the 'make' utility installed on your system, you can compile the program by unzipping the archive, moving to the folder containing the makefile, and running the 'make' command.
If you are using a compiler other than g++, you will first need to change the CXX field at the top of the makefile to the program name of your compiler.

Once compiled, MAGMA is a self-contained executable and does not need to be otherwise installed. If the magma file is placed in a directory that is included in the PATH variable, it can be called from anywhere by simply entering 'magma' followed by the desired arguments at the command line. 
Otherwise, the path to the file must be added (eg. './magma' if it is in the current directory.

Documentation and auxiliary files can be found on the MAGMA site at http://ctglab.nl/software/magma
